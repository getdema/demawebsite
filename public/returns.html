    <h2>Return Policy</h2>
    <h3>Last Updated: May 26, 2022</h3>
    <h4>Returns Policies
    </h4>
    <div>
        <p>Most sellers on DeMa offer returns for items within 30 days of receipt of shipment. Instructions for returns, return label generation along with shipment / drop-off options for returning the items would be provided to you on your order/returns section by the sellers. DeMa will not specify the return policies. They are developed and enforced by sellers in coordination with DeMa facilities for a seamless experience to both buyers and sellers. DeMa suggests what are the preferred and most offered return policies on the platform to the sellers. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>While the individual return policies are set by the sellers, the following items generally can’t be returned. </p>
        <ul >
            <li>
                <p>Grocery Products, Jewelry and some restricted category items, Some health & personal care products</p>
            </li>
            <li>Products missing the serial number or UPC</li>
            <li>Any software products, Online subscriptions after they have been accessed
            </li>
            <li>Gift cards, prepaid cards etc (except as required by law)
            </li>
            <li>Items with special shipping restrictions
            </li>
            <li>Any items more than 30 days after delivery
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            After the carrier receives your item, it can take up to four weeks for the seller to receive and process your return. DeMa typically process returns within 3-5 business days after the carrier delivers the item and seller confirms this. When DeMa completes processing your return, a refund is issued to your selected payment method. In limited cases, depending on the seller policies DeMa may issue an instant refund as DeMa credit to your account. This credit can only be used when shopping on DeMa or as described in offers provided by DeMa.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Cancellation Policies
    </h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            You can cancel orders that haven't entered the shipping process yet. You can go to your order page and select the order you want to cancel and Cancel items in an order or cancel the complete order. After submitting the cancellation, you'll receive a confirmation message on the screen. You'll also receive a mail / message in your account. Typically, it will take 30 - 60 mins to stage the orders for fulfillment & shipping and you can cancel the order within this time frame and payment would be refunded to your account within 3-5 business days. Once this 30-60 mins time post order has been placed, sometimes the option to request cancellation expires as the seller would have already shipped the order. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            If you no longer see Request Cancellation, contact the seller for instructions. In most cases, the seller might cancel it on their end or suggest you select cancel the delivery if it’s already shipped via one of the methods prescribed by the seller (e.g.: directly intimate to the shipping carrier to cancel and send it back to seller). If this option is not available (e.g.: because multiple carriers were involved in shipping this order), you may be able to return the item(s) purchased using the returns process pursuant to the seller’s terms and conditions for each item.
