    <h2>Shipping Policy

    <h4>Shipping Policies
    </h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            Shipping policies including rates, estimated times, free shipping available or minimum order size for shipping etc., would be available to the buyer at the time of order, browsing through various listings as well as specified during checkout after a product has been added to the cart. Often, users can choose between different shipping speeds to get more savings or reduced rates. The total shipping & handling cost as well as the estimated date of delivery, will be listed under the Order Summary page. 

        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The shipping policies, rates, tracking, and delivery are handled by sellers and DeMa only indicates a suggested shipping policy for the listings to the sellers to make the shipping policy convenient for the buyers and the ultimate responsibility for shipping and delivery lies with the sellers. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Track Your Package
    </h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            Tracking information is provided to buyers along with the order details. If an order includes multiple items, each may have separate delivery dates and tracking information. Depending on the shipping method you chose, it's possible that the tracking information might not be visible immediately.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <span class="bold">Note:</span> Some packages, such as standard international deliveries, aren't trackable. There could be some other reasons, that tracking information is delayed or not available, please wait for 1 to 2 days and reach out to customer service to get support on this.  If the estimated delivery date for your package has passed and your tracking information hasn't changed, allow an additional day or two for the package to be delivered. If your package shows as delivered but you haven't yet received it, please use the contact details on carrier contact information that customer service ( <a href="mailto:hello@getdema.shop" class="blue-link">hello@getdema.shop</a> ) provides you or listed in the shipment tracking details.

        </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Late Deliveries
    </h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            Most packages arrive on time. Orders sometimes show up after the estimated delivery date, due to missing / incorrect address (Details missing such as Appt #), customs, weather, or any other unforeseen conditions. In most cases, the tracking link should give updates regarding the delays and specific actions. If the issue canâ€™t be resolved with tracking / carrier service within 1-2 days after scheduled delivery date, you can reach out to our customer service (<a href="mailto:hello@getdema.shop" class="blue-link">hello@getdema.shop</a> ) and they will help to resolve this.
