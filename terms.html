            <p>When and as enabled you may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content; and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages.

        <h4>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COMPLAINTS
        </h4>
        <div>
            <p>
                DeMa respects the intellectual property of others. If you believe that your intellectual property rights are being infringed, please send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@getdema.shop" class="blue-link">hello@getdema.shops</a>. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <h4>RISK OF LOSS</h4>
        <div><p>When DeMa ships purchased and digital items from DeMa owned and/or managed resources and facilities, such shipments are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon delivery to the carrier. 
        </p></div>
        <h4>RETURNS, REFUNDS AND TITLE</h4>
        <div><p>DeMa does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at DeMa’s represented fulfillment center. At the discretion as per the agreement set by DeMa and Seller, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, DeMa does not take title to the refunded item. 
        </p></div>
        <h4>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS
        </h4>
        <div><p>DeMa attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, DeMa does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any DeMa Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by DeMa itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition. Once services offered by DeMa are rendered, they are not returnable and any relief may be sought by opening a case with DeMa by e-mail at <a href="mailto:hello@getdema.shop" class="blue-link">hello@getdema.shop</a>. In the case a resolution cannot be mutually agreed upon, the Seller has the right to a dispute resolution process.
        </p></div>
        <h4>PRICING</h4>
        <div><p>"List Price" means the suggested retail price of a product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. With respect to items sold by DeMa, we cannot confirm the price of an item until an order is placed. Despite DeMa’s best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold through DeMa is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. However, sellers may have and follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item. Please refer to the policies as set forth by the seller on the page outlining their Terms of Service  and Conditions of Use.
        </p></div>
        <h4>APP PERMISSIONS
        </h4>
        <div><p>When you use apps created by DeMa, such as the browser extension or Mobile Apps, you may grant certain permissions to DeMa on your device. Most mobile devices provide you with information about these permissions before they are granted. 
        </p></div>
